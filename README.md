# Weather_Forecasting_using_MachineLearning
In my research endeavors focused on Seattle weather prediction, I've successfully developed a versatile weather prediction model. 

The process involved a meticulous exploration of the data, including plotting various pair plots and cat plots to discern meaningful patterns and relationships between different weather parameters. Employing the scikit-learn library, a powerful tool for machine learning in Python, enabled the application of diverse classification models. 

These models, ranging from logistic regression and support vector machines (SVM) to k-nearest neighbors (KNN) and random forest (RF), were systematically implemented and assessed for their predictive accuracy. The outcomes were promising, with each model demonstrating its efficacy in this context, yielding accuracy rates of 76%, 79%, 67%, 84%, 72%, 80%, and 72% for logistic regression, SVM, KNN, naive Bayes, decision tree (DTR), random forest (RF), and XGBoost, respectively. 

These results underscore the potential of utilizing machine learning techniques for precise and insightful weather predictions specific to the Seattle region.
